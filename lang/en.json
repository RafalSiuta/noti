In certain circumstances, you may also object to processing. To make a request, please use the contact details below. If we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you may withdraw your consent at any time; this will not affect the lawfulness of processing prior to withdrawal nor processing based on other legal grounds.

If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please send it to the email address provided below. If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account, you have the right to request the removal of unwanted data. To request removal, contact us with the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the data is not publicly displayed in the App; however, please note that the data may not be completely removed from all our systems (e.g., backups)."
